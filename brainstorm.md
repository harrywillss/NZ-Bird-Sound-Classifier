# NZ Bird Classifier Model
*A model trained to classify New Zealand bird sounds by their MƒÅori identity.*

## Data
Maybe just download the New Zealand files off of Xeno-canto and analyse the data to be cleaned. API calling should do the job...

## Research
- Training classification models on sound
- Potential models
- Ways to make the sound interpretable
